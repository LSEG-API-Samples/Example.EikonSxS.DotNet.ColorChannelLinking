# Color channel linking using Eikon SxS API.

This example demonstrates the use of ["Eikon Side by Side Integration API"](https://developers.refinitiv.com/eikon-apis/side-side-integration-api/) to implement linking on a color channel. The example is a WPF application, which connects to Thomson Reuters Eikon or Refinitiv Workspace application, retrieves the list of color channels available, presents these channels to the user and allows the user to link this WPF application on one of these color channels to publish context to and receive context from Eikon or Refinitiv Workspace. 

**Pre-requisites:** 

**Thomson Reuters Eikon** or **Refinitiv Workspace**.
